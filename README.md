# ImageClassification
Machine Learning Assignment on Facial Recognition

# Library Dependancies
Sklearn, SkImage, Keras, Tensorflow, DLib, pandas, numpy, joblib, Open-CV(cv2).

# Additional Dependencies
Some functions such as saving models and loading them back might require some additional libraries such as h5py for keras.

# Code
There are 4 distinct files:   
-- Classifier.py: Trains CNN for all tasks  
-- tranferLearning.py: Feature extraction with ResNet and train linear SVM   
-- ImagePreprocessor.py: Class for ImagePreproccessing prior to training   
-- Predictions.py: For writing final predictions to CSV
